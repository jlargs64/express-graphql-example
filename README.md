# Express GraphQL Example

A robust, production-ready API built with TypeScript, Express, and Pino logger. I plan on using this as a template for future microservices and APIs.

## Features

- TypeScript for type safety
- Express.js for routing and middleware
- CORS enabled
- Helmet for security headers
- Pino for fast and structured logging
- PM2 for process management in production
- Environment-based configuration

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm (v6+ recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
1. Set up the .env file based on the .env.example
